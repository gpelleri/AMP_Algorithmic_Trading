# Algorithmic Trading using Three Strategies

This project explores algorithmic trading through three major strategy types: technical analysis, value-based investing, and machine learning. It was developed as part of the Applied Masters Project for the M.Sc. in Financial Engineering at EDHEC Business School.

## Strategies Implemented

- **Technical Strategies**: Moving Average Crossovers, RSI-based Momentum
- **Value-Based Strategy**: Price-to-Earnings and Price-to-Book ratio models with dynamic thresholds
- **Machine Learning Models**: ANN, RNN, LSTM, and CNN-based forecasting of returns and prices

## Features

- Custom backtesting engine with realistic execution logic
- In-sample tuning and out-of-sample validation
- Performance metrics: Return, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown
- Time series cross-validation for ML models

## Technologies

- Python (NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Bloomberg data for financial metrics
